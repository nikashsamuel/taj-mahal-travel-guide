    <h1>Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj<br> Mahal? </h1><br>
    <p>Quite honestly, we can’t think of one.</p><br><br>
    <p>At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent <br>than building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than <br.seeing its magnificence up close.

    </p><br><br>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">After all, this is art. Built in Agra, <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india">India</a></span> between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history.<br> And, of course, it’s the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos.<br> So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts –<br> from Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases.

        <br><br>Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond), and so much more…</p>
        <h1>Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</h1><br>
        <p>That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.</p> <br>
        <p>
            Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian<br>
             men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour.<br>
             Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/indias-golden-triangle-143456">8-day Golden Triangle tours</a></span> (now with solo-only <br>
             departures!) to 15-day trips dedicated to food, to 19-day trips combining the <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/en/india/highlights-india-nepal-143752">highlights of India <br>and Nepal</a></span>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>If you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal on a whirlwind day tour from<br>
             Delhi. Check out <span style="color: blue;">Urban Adventures</span>
              to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this. And while<br>
              you’re at it, check out their day trips in Delhi, Jaipur, Varanasi and Mumbai!</p><br>

          <br> <p>The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally<br>
             prepared, you’ll be fine. What’s to come is more than worth the wait…</p> <br>
             <h1>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h1>
             <br>
             <p>Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to<br>
                 have minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.</p><br>
                 <p>You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:</p><br>
                 <div class="in-ul">
                    <ul><li>Passport</li></ul>
                 <ul><li>Money</li></ul>
                 <ul><li>Water</li></ul>
                 <ul><li>Medicine</li></ul>
                 <ul><li>Camera</li></ul>
                 <ul><li>Phone</li></ul>

                 </div><br>
                 <h1>What to wear to the Taj Mahal</h1>
                 <br>
                 <p>There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will<br>
                     need to cover your head, shoulders and knees.<br>
                     <p>It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear<br>
                         sunscreen. Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too.<br>
                         <p>If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid<br>
                             the worst of the heat.</p><br>

                            <br> <p>Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:</p>

                     <h1>Other things you need to know </h1><br>
                     <p>No food is allowed inside.</p><br>
                     <p>Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed.</p>
                     <p>Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with.<br>
                         Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small<br>
                          video cameras) are not allowed.<br>

                        <br>Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area, but keep your<br>
                         wits about you and you won’t need to worry!</p>
                         <h1>When you’re at the Taj Mahal</h1><br>
                         <p>Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if<br>
                             possible).</p>
                             <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/India_Agra_taj_mahal_crowds_185.jpg"><br>
                             <p>If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an<br>
                                 amazing photo from the riverbank behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw to<br>
                                  take you there and back cheaply.)<br> <br>

                                And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly<br>
                                 (or more!) remain in awe of it. Sana Jinah, one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has<br>
                                  some tips on how to do this:</p>

                                  <p>She also recommends those looking for optimum conditions try visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise<br>
                                     on a clear day.</p>
                                     <h1>Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</h1><br>
                                     <p>Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit<br>
                                         on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop.</p>
                                         <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_agra_taj-mahal_taking-in-the-surroundings.jpg">
                                         <p>But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth <br>
                                            seeking out.

                                            Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/pravin-intrepid-manager-gender-equality-india/">Pravin <br>

<p>You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal.<br>
     Unfortunately, Agra does get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the<br>
     day and around sunset. That said, this can make shots look very atmospheric!</p>

     <h1>What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</h1><br>
     <p>First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. Then<br>
         explore these cool destinations both in and out of Agra:</p>
        <br> <h1>What to do in Agra</h1><br>
         <p>The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra Fort is <br>
            also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century<br>
             Mughal monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, it’s a sight not to be missed.</p><br>
             <p>Despite being located on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, there’s less to do in Agra than in<br>
                 many other Indian cities. It’s pretty polluted from the heavy industry (more on that later) and you<br>
                  likely won’t spend too long there, whatever the trip.

             </p><br>
             <p>One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by <br>
                (sometimes) taking travelers to Sheroes Hangout. Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a small cafe<br>
                 run entirely by female acid attack survivors. Here, victims of attacks are employed and tell<br>
                  their stories. It can be confronting, but also inspiring and memorable in equal measures.</p><br>

                 <h1>Where to go outside of Agra</h1>    <br>
                 <p>There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. Of these,<br>
                     Orchha, Jaipur and Pushkar are all tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful places.<br><br>

                    Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic, laid-back<br>
                     and has a bunch of beautiful temples. It’s not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN visit<br>
